# Monitoring
Project 4 
Monitoring and Logging 
 
Sub Tasks 
 
Sub Task 1: Set up AWS CloudWatch for basic monitoring. 
 
•	Create CloudWatch Alarms for key metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage). 
•	Configure notifications for alarm actions (e.g., SNS, Lambda). 
•	Set up CloudWatch Dashboards for an overview of system health. 
 
Sub Task 2: Create custom metrics and alarms to monitor specific application behaviour. 
 
•	Define custom metrics based on application-specific APIs. • 	Implement CloudWatch Alarms for these custom metrics. 
•	Create CloudWatch Events for automated responses to specific events. 
 
Sub Task 3: Configure AWS CloudTrail for auditing. 
 
•	Enable CloudTrail in all AWS regions. 
•	Set up CloudTrail to log to an S3 bucket and optionally to CloudWatch Logs. 
•	Define trails with specific filters for more granular logging. 
 
Sub Task 4: Implement security monitoring and anomaly detection. 
 
•	Create CloudWatch Alarms for security-related events. 
•	Implement anomaly detection using CloudWatch Insights. 
•	Integrate security monitoring with AWS Security Hub for a comprehensive view.
